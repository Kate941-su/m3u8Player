## swipeAction()
Add additional actions in the row in the list

## Navigation Stack
- It has the most highest hierarchy
- It is used 'Lazy Loading' which means that the app doesn't render all of screens where the app might visit the screen.
- It distincts each item by Int type id.
- `[$stackPath`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-hQWMjT0s) can make a limitation of which path you will go as a next screen.
- `Equtable` can create the two ways. 
  - Creating automatically if the struct is structed as premitive types.
  ```
   struct VideoData: Identifiable, Equatable {
       var id: UUID = UUID() // Assuming you have this property
       var title: String
       var url: URL
   }
  ```

  - Defining yourself
  ```
   struct VideoData: Identifiable {
    var id: UUID = UUID()
    var title: String
    var url: URL
    
    // Manually implement Equatable
    static func ==(lhs: VideoData, rhs: VideoData) -> Bool {
        return lhs.id == rhs.id &&
               lhs.title == rhs.title &&
               lhs.url == rhs.url
    }
  }
  ```


## 05.10 Summay
I learned that composable architecture thinks about project wants to struct state as each component unit it doesn't have to depend on `view` (because I'm familiar with MVVM so I tend to connect state as view model)

I can add simple Composable Architecture features.

I am getting used to using SwiftUI grammers.

## TODO
- Adding items and holding item state (delete, add, update )
- Adding a persistence layer (SQLite?)
- AVFoundation to play HLS stream soundsðŸŽ¼

- Store instance has to be only one in the project. Because if you create two more instance by the each state that you want to manage it will be managed on a diffrent memory address.

- To prevent from the above you create a store on the root of the hierarchy where you want to handle your components.

- There is a suitable application named SF Symbol x. where all of icons are here.

- I learned how to construct Botton Navigation Bar in SwiftUI
